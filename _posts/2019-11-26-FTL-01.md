Reversing object structures with Cheat Engine.
First part of the FTL post series.

<!--more-->

Let me preface this post by acknowledging that I haven't posted a single thing in over a year. Whoops. I'm back now.

## Introduction

The intent of this and the next couple posts are to form a coherent series that anyone can follow along to create their very own FTL cheat.

The end goal here is to go from cheat engine addresses to cheat table to standalone trainer. Hopefully following the trainer development process as closely as possible.

Before starting, you should have CE installed and ready to go and a copy of Faster Than Light (FTL).
Basic programming knowledge and understanding of hexadecimal numbers (base 16) is recommended.

## First glance

Start by loading up to the main menu and starting a new game. Immediately you can see multiple stats of interest.

These are all easily retrieved via a quick memory scan.

(I'll get to the ship's power and characters shortly)

Notice how closely the addresses from each other. From that it's reasonable to assume they are part of the same structure. To confirm this, find out what accesses the Fuel address (F5) and inspect any of the opcodes. We're presented with this.

*cmp [eax+0x494], 03*

If you are blissfully unaware of assembly, let me break down the relevant bit.
Our fuel address (in my case 0x1BFB33B4) is being accessed by the pointer EAX + 0x494. as you can see at the bottom of the screenshot EAX is equal to 0x1BFB2F20. 0x1BFB2F20 + 0x494 indeed matches our address. What this entails is that the game does not directly access the fuel address but instead reads a 'containter' object with an offset to the fuel. EAX is that object's address.

It's also fair to assume our money address is part of this same object. Find out what accesses it again.. yep. offset of 0x4D4

We can tell cheat engine to read our values through this pointer as the game does.

## Pointers

By this point you may be wondering why bother with pointers at all when you can just use the direct memory address.

Using pointers provides us with a few advantages down the road. First of all it cuts down our work exponentially. Instead of having a bunch of hardcoded addresses we have a couple pointers with their own offsets.
Let me try to illustrate this with some pseudocode.


```C

// Each variable has their own reference address

// All the addresses change each time the executable is ran.
int someVar; // 0x0040000
int someVar; // 0x0040030
int someVar; // 0x0040060
int someVar; // 0x0040100
int someVar; // 0x0042050


// One variable

struct aStructure {
 int someVar; // + 0x00
 int someVar; // + 0x04
 int someVar; // + 0x08
 int someVar; // + 0x0C
 int someVar; // + 0x10
};

aStructure someStruct; // 0x0040010 // This address changes each time the executable is ran
```

Refinding each address every time you launch your game would be extremely annoying to say the least. This leads us to the other major reason we use pointers. A lot of the time you can easily find *static* pointers to your pointers. A static pointer is set once the executable is compiled and does not change after that. This lets us reuse the same address until a game update is released.

Okay, how do you find a static pointer to our object? Think about it. If a pointer points to our object, then the pointer's value must be equal to that object's address. It's as easy as doing a mmemory scan for it!

In cheat engine, a green address represents a static address. So for me (and you if you're running the same version of FTL!) the static pointer is 0x8C548C (or FTLGame.exe+4C548C if ASLR is enabled on your PC)

To read our fuel/money value with this pointer. Read the value of it, add the offset and read the value of that.
[FTLGame.exe+4C548C] + 0x494 -> Fuel
[FTLGame.exe+4C548C] + 0x4D4 -> Money
